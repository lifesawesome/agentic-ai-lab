    "## 📊 Available Evaluators in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry provides a comprehensive set of built-in evaluators for different aspects of AI model quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Quality (AI Assisted)**\n",
    "- **Groundedness** - Measures how well responses are grounded in provided context\n",
    "- **Relevance** - Evaluates how relevant responses are to the input query  \n",
    "- **Coherence** - Assesses logical flow and consistency in responses\n",
    "- **Fluency** - Measures language quality and readability\n",
    "- **GPT Similarity** - Compares responses to reference answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Quality (NLP Metrics)**\n",
    "- **F1 Score** - Measures precision and recall balance\n",
    "- **ROUGE Score** - Evaluates text summarization quality\n",
    "- **BLEU Score** - Measures translation and generation quality\n",
    "- **GLEU Score** - Google's BLEU variant for better correlation\n",
    "- **METEOR Score** - Considers synonyms and stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Risk and Safety**\n",
    "- **Violence** - Detects violent content\n",
    "- **Sexual** - Identifies sexual content\n",
    "- **Self-harm** - Detects self-harm related content\n",
    "- **Hate/Unfairness** - Identifies hateful or unfair content\n",
    "- **Protected Material** - Detects copyrighted content\n",
    "- **Indirect Attack** - Identifies indirect prompt injection attempts\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate AI models using Azure AI Foundry with both **local** and **cloud** evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Does:\n",
    "1. **Setup & Data Creation** - Creates synthetic health & fitness Q&A data\n",
    "2. **Local Evaluation** - Runs F1Score and Relevance evaluators locally  \n",
    "3. **Cloud Evaluation** - Uploads results to Azure AI Foundry project\n",
