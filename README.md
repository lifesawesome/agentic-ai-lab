## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Repository Setup

```powershell
# Clone the laboratory repository
git clone https://github.com/dhangerkapil/agentic-ai-lab.git
cd agentic-ai-lab

# Verify Python version (if not using DevContainer)
python --version  # Python 3.12 preferred
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Development Environment

You have two options for setting up your development environment:

#### Option A: Local Python Environment (Standard venv)

If you prefer a local setup or don't have Docker:

```powershell
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies with locked versions for reproducibility
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **💡 Note:** This project uses pip-tools for dependency management to ensure consistent installations across all environments. All required packages (including pip-tools) are automatically installed from `requirements.txt`.
> 
> **📝 For Maintainers:** See [README_DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md](README_DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md) for instructions on updating dependencies.

#### Option B: DevContainer (Recommended for Docker Users) 🐳

If you have **Docker Desktop** installed, use the DevContainer for a fully configured environment:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Open in DevContainer:**
   - Open the repository folder in VS Code
   - When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"** or
   - Press `F1` → Select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**

3. **What's Included:**
   - ✅ Python 3.12 pre-configured
   - ✅ All dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically installed
   - ✅ VS Code extensions (Python, Jupyter, Pylance, Azure)
   - ✅ Azure CLI pre-installed
   - ✅ Consistent environment across all machines

> **💡 Tip:** The DevContainer automatically installs all packages with locked versions. No manual setup required!

### Step 4: Microsoft Foundry Setup

1. **Create Microsoft Foundry Resource and Project**
   
   To create a Microsoft Foundry resource in the Azure portal follow these instructions:

   - Select this Microsoft Foundry resource link: https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIFoundry

   - On the Create page, provide the following information:

   <img src="images/ai-foundry-deployment.png" width="75%"/>

   | Project details | Description |
   |----------------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | Select one of your available Azure subscriptions. |
   | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group that will contain your Azure AI Foundry resource. You can create a new group or add it to a preexisting group. |
   | **Region** | The location of your Azure AI service instance. Different locations may introduce latency, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. |
   | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Microsoft Foundry resource. For example, MyAIServicesResource. |
   | **Default Project Name** | Keep the default project as it is. |

   - Keep other settings for your resource as default, read and accept the conditions (as applicable), and then select **Review + create**.

2. **Assign Azure AI User Role**
   
   **Important:** Developers and lab attendees must be assigned the **Azure AI User** role to interact with the Microsoft Foundry project:
   
   - **Recommended:** Assign at the **Project level**
   - **Alternative:** If encountering permission issues, assign at the **Foundry Resource level**
   
   This role provides the necessary permissions to deploy models, create agents, and execute AI operations.
   
   For detailed guidance, follow the [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry?view=foundry-classic) documentation.
   
3. **Deploy Required Models & Services**
   
   | Model Type | Recommended Models | Purpose |
   |------------|-------------------|---------|
   | **Chat/Completion** | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` | Primary reasoning & conversation |
   | **Text Embeddings** | `text-embedding-3-large` | Vector search & RAG |

   - On the left Nav Menu of the foundry portal go to Models+endpoints
   - Click Deploy a model button-->Deploy base model
      - Search for the models in the table above , select a model, click confirm and Deploy and connect
       <img src="images/deploy-models.png" width="75%"/>

4. **Configure an Azure Search Service**
   - Create an Azure AI Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your Microsoft Foundry project
      - Navigate to your Microsoft Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure AI Search
      <img src="images/foundry-connection.png" width="75%"/>

5. **Configure Grounding with Bing Search**
   - Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your Microsoft Foundry project
      - Navigate to your Microsoft Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Grounding with Bing Search

6. **Connect Application Insights for Observability**
   - Connect an Application Insights resource to your Foundry project for monitoring and observability
   - Follow the detailed guide: [Monitor applications with Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/monitor-applications?view=foundry-classic)
   - This enables tracking of agent performance, model usage, and troubleshooting

7. **Create Content Understanding Resource**
   - Create an Azure AI Content Understanding multi-service resource following the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/how-to/create-multi-service-resource)
   - Ensure the resource is created in a supported region (westus, swedencentral, australiaeast)
  
8. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and update values accordingly
   - This repository expects the `.env` file to be in the root directory, if you want to store it elsewhere or name it something else, update the `load_dotenv()` calls in notebooks
   - Many of the Environment Variables needed can be found in the Overview tab of your Microsoft Foundry project or the connected resources in the Management Center tab
   - For example, AZURE_OPENAI variables-

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support

### ⚡ Common Issues & Solutions

**Kernel Issues in VS Code:**
```powershell
# Refresh kernel registration
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ai-foundry-lab --display-name="AI Foundry Lab"
# Reload VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

**Environment Activation Problems:**
```powershell
# Set PowerShell execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Verify virtual environment
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

**Azure Authentication Issues:**
```powershell
# Recommended: Use Azure CLI authentication
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show

# Alternative: Clear cached credentials and re-login
az account clear
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show
```

> **Note:** If you see deprecation warnings about the Azure Account extension in VS Code, use `az login` in the terminal instead. The Azure Account extension for VS Code has been deprecated in favor of Azure CLI authentication.
