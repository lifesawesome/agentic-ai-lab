    "We find that they often create a single file that contains not only the claim document but also all the supporting douments.\n",
    "Because this may include statements, bills and receipts from many different doctors, hospitals and labs, there is no way to extract from the varied document types without parsing the raw OCR data or creating custom input templates."

    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Azure [AI Content Understanding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview) service to:\n",
    "1. Create a classifier to categorize bundled documents inside a single PDF file\n",
    "2. Create 3 custom analyzers to extract specific fields from specific document types.\n",
    "3. Combine classifier and the 3 analyzers to create an enhanced classier\n",
    "4. Classify, logically split, and analyze multiple documents bundled in a single PDF file.\n",

    "5. Add the Content Understanding Resource as a connected resource to the project.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Keep track of the [AI Content Understanding release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/whats-new) to know when Content Understanding becomes fully integrated with the new type of AI Foundry projects."
