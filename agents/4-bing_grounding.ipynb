    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** a project using Azure AI Foundry.\n",
    "2. **Create an Agent** with the **BingGroundingTool** for web search.\n",
    "3. **Ask real-world questions** about health and fitness.\n",
    "4. **Retrieve and display** answers, including Bing query URLs and disclaimers.\n",

      "ASSISTANT: Recent research continues to support intermittent fasting (IF) as an effective strategy for weight management. A 2025 study highlighted that structured fasting, such as intermittent energy restriction (IER), impacts the brain-gut-microbiome axis. This includes changes in the gut microbiome and specific brain activity during fasting, which can influence weight loss and eating behaviors. Participants in the study achieved significant weight loss over nearly two months of the practice【3:1†source】.\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. **Accuracy** – Bing search results may include disclaimers or partial info. Encourage verification with credible sources.\n",
    "2. **Bing Query Display** – For compliance with Bing's use and display requirements, show both **website URLs** (in the agent's response) and **Bing search query URLs** (shown above). If the model includes citations, display them as well.\n",
    "3. **Limits** – Keep an eye on usage, rate limits, or policy constraints for Bing.\n",
    "4. **Privacy** – Filter search queries to avoid sending sensitive data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluations** – Use `azure-ai-evaluation` for iterative improvement.\n"

    "## 🛠️ **Critical Fixes Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Environment Variable Correction**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong environment variable name:\n",
    "bing_conn_name = os.environ.get(\"BING_CONNECTION_NAME\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct environment variable name:\n",
    "bing_conn_name = os.environ.get(\"GROUNDING_WITH_BING_CONNECTION_NAME\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Connection API Fix**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong API parameter:\n",
    "bing_connection = project_client.connections.get(connection_name=bing_conn_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct API parameter:\n",
    "bing_connection = project_client.connections.get(name=bing_conn_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Bing Tool Configuration Fix**\n",
    "The critical fix was the `search_configurations` array format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This caused \"must be an array with exactly 1 elements\" error:\n",
    "bing_tool_def = {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"bing_grounding\",\n",
    "    \"bing_grounding\": {\n",
    "        \"connection_id\": conn_id\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct format with search_configurations array:\n",
    "bing_tool_def = {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"bing_grounding\", \n",
    "    \"bing_grounding\": {\n",
    "        \"search_configurations\": [{\n",
    "            \"connection_id\": conn_id\n",
    "        }]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Enhanced Error Handling**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Added connection debugging:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    connections = project_client.connections.list()\n",
    "    print(\"Available connections:\")\n",
    "    for conn in connections:\n",
    "        print(f\"  - {conn.name} (ID: {conn.id})\")\n",
    "except Exception as list_error:\n",
    "    print(f\"  Could not list connections: {list_error}\")\n",
