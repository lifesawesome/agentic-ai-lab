      "Test 4: Goal Setting\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "👤 User: How can I set realistic fitness goals for someone who wants to lose 20 pounds safely?\n",
      "🔄 Creating thread and processing with agent...\n",
      "✅ Agent processing completed! (Run ID: run_SxAzysAJODey0zvmtyJT9TrL)\n",
      "🤖 Agent: Setting realistic and safe fitness goals is crucial for sustainable success and overall health. Losing 20 pounds is an attainable goal, but the emphasis should be on creating healthy long-term habits rather than just fast results. Here are some steps to get started:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Make the Big Goal Specific and Time-Bound**\n",
      "- A healthy rate of weight loss is **1 to 2 pounds per week**, which means losing 20 pounds could take roughly **10 to 20 weeks**. \n",
      "- Instead of just saying, \"I want to lose weight,\" try reframing the goal: \"I want to lose 20 pounds in 4 to 5 months by exercising and eating healthily.\"\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Why this matters:** Setting a gradual timeline honors your body’s limits, helps preserve lean muscle, and reduces the risk of gaining the weight back.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Focus on Process-Based Goals Rather Than Only the End Result**  \n",
      "Set smaller, actionable goals that will lead to your larger goal. For example:\n",
      "- Exercise **4-5 days per week** for 30 to 60 minutes.\n",
      "- Eat a **balanced, nutrient-rich diet with whole foods**.\n",
      "- Drink **more water** and cut back on sugary drinks.\n",
      "- Aim for **7-9 hours of quality sleep** nightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this matters:** Consistently focusing on healthy habits will naturally lead to better results over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Develop a Personalized and Well-Rounded Exercise Plan**\n",
      "A combination of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises is typically ideal:\n",
      "- **Cardio (3-5 days a week):** Activities like brisk walking, running, cycling, or swimming can help burn calories. Start at a moderate intensity and gradually increase.\n",
      "- **Strength Training (2-3 days a week):** Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks helps build muscle, which burns more calories at rest.\n",
      "- **Flexibility/Recovery Work (1-2 days a week):** Stretching, yoga, or foam rolling aids recovery and prevents injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip:** Consult a fitness professional to ensure your workouts are safe and effective for your current level.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Prioritize Nutrition Without Over-Restricting**\n",
      "- **Caloric Deficit:** To lose weight, consume slightly fewer calories than your body burns, but don’t go below 1,200 calories/day for women or 1,500 calories/day for men without a doctor’s advice.\n",
      "- **Aim for Balanced Meals:** Build meals with lean protein, high-fiber carbs (whole grains, fruits, and vegetables), and healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocados).\n",
      "- **Practice Portion Control:** Use smaller plates, measure servings, and avoid eating straight from packages.\n",
      "- **Avoid Overly Restrictive Diets:** Extreme calorie-cutting or fad diets are unsustainable and may harm your health.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Track Progress Beyond the Scale**\n",
      "Weight can fluctuate due to water retention, hormonal changes, and muscle gain. Gauge progress with additional methods, such as:\n",
      "- How your clothes fit.\n",
      "- Energy levels and quality of sleep.\n",
      "- Improvements in stamina or strength.\n",
      "- Consistency in making healthier food choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Address Mental and Emotional Health**\n",
      "- **Setbacks are Normal:** Understand that progress isn't linear, and it's okay to have off days.\n",
      "- **Focus on Self-Care:** Stress management (e.g., mindfulness, deep breathing, or journaling) can prevent emotional eating.\n",
      "- **Reward Yourself Safely:** Celebrate milestones with non-food rewards (like buying workout gear or booking a massage).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **7. Consult Professionals**\n",
      "- **Healthcare Provider:** Talk to your doctor to ensure your plan is safe and appropriate for your current health, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications.\n",
      "- **Registered Dietitian:** They can help you create an individualized diet plan.\n",
      "- **Personal Trainer:** Work with a trainer to fine-tune your exercise routine.\n",

      "👤 User: I'm a 35-year-old office worker who sits most of the day. I want to start exercising but I have limited time (only 20 minutes, 3 times per week). What would you recommend for someone with back pain from sitting too long?\n",

      "🤖 Agent: It’s great that you want to start exercising! A sedentary lifestyle combined with back pain can be challenging, but consistent movement and specific exercises can help. Since you have limited time and want to avoid aggravating your back pain, focusing on low-impact, full-body exercises that also strengthen your core and improve posture is a good strategy. Here's a beginner-friendly plan for your 20-minute, 3-times-per-week workouts:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Warm-Up (3–5 minutes):**\n",
      "Start with light movement to prepare your body and reduce stiffness:\n",
      "1. **Cat-Cow Stretch (1–2 mins)**: Alternate between arching and rounding your back while on all fours.\n",
      "2. **Pelvic Tilts (30 seconds-1 min)**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet on the floor. Gently tilt your pelvis back and forth to loosen your lower back.\n",
      "3. **Standing Arm Circles/Shoulder Rolls (1 min)**: Gently rotate your arms or shoulders to release any upper-body tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Main Exercises:**\n",
      "Choose 5–6 exercises from this list, and do each for 40 seconds followed by 20 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit twice in your 20 minutes if time allows.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Glute Bridges (strengthens back and core):**\n",
      "   - Lie on your back, knees bent, and feet flat. Lift your hips toward the ceiling while squeezing your glutes. Lower gently and repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Body-Weight Squats (strengthens legs and supports posture):**\n",
      "   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Keeping your chest up, lower yourself as if sitting in a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bird-Dog (core and back alignment):**\n",
      "   - Start on all fours. Extend your right arm and left leg simultaneously, keeping your back flat. Bring back to the starting position, then switch sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Wall Push-Ups (gentler for beginners):**\n",
      "   - Stand about arm’s length from a wall. Place hands shoulder-width apart on the wall and perform a push-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Side Plank (core and obliques):**\n",
      "   - Lie on your side with knees bent or legs extended. Lift your hips and hold your weight on your elbow and feet or knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Seated Rows (strengthens upper back):**\n",
      "   - Use a resistance band or light weights if available. Sit down or stand, mimicking the motion of rowing—pull your hands toward your torso while squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Toe Taps (gentle core activation):**\n",
      "   - Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Slowly lower one foot to tap the floor, then return to the starting position, alternating legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Cool Down (2–5 minutes):**\n",
      "Perform a few gentle stretches to relax your muscles:\n",
      "1. **Child’s Pose:** Sit back on your heels with arms extended forward, stretching your lower back.\n",
      "2. **Spinal Twist:** Sit or lie on your back, letting one leg cross over your body for a gentle twist.\n",
      "3. **Hamstring Stretch:** Sit on the floor and extend one leg straight out in front of you, reaching gently toward your foot.\n",
      "4. **Deep Breaths:** End with a comfortable seated position, closing your eyes as you take deep belly breaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Tips for Success:**\n",
      "- **Listen to Your Body:** Go slow and avoid any movements that cause pain. Focus on proper form instead of speed.\n",
      "- **Vary Positions:** Exercises that don’t require prolonged sitting (like planks or squats) can help counteract the effects of your desk job.\n",
      "- **Stay Consistent:** 20 minutes, 3 times per week is a great start! Consistency is key to seeing long-term benefits.\n",
      "- **Move During the Day:** Set reminders to stand up, stretch, and walk around every 30–60 minutes during your workday.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you mentioned existing back pain, it’s important to incorporate light stretching into your daily routine in addition to these workouts, and consider including core stabilization exercises.
