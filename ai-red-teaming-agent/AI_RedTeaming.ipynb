    "# AI Red Teaming Agent for Generative AI models and applications in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to use Azure AI Evaluation's AI Red Teaming Agent functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems against adversarial prompt attacks. AI Red Teaming Agent leverages [Risk and Safety Evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#risk-and-safety-evaluators) to help identify potential safety issues across different risk categories (violence, hate/unfairness, sexual content, self-harm) combined with attack strategies of varying complexity levels from [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), Microsoft AI Red Teaming team's open framework for automated AI red teaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 30-45 minutes running this notebook. Execution time will vary based on the number of risk categories, attack strategies, and complexity levels you choose to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "First, if you have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure AI hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources) then [create an Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources). AI projects and Hubs can be served within a private network and are compatible with private endpoints. You **do not** need to provide your own LLM deployment as the AI Red Teaming Agent hosts adversarial models for both simulation and evaluation of harmful content and connects to it via your Azure AI project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to upload your results to Azure AI Foundry:\n",
    "- Your AI Foundry project must have a connection (*Connected Resources*) to a storage account with `Microsoft Entra ID` authentication enabled.\n",
    "- Your AI Foundry project must have the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role in the storage account.\n",
    "- You must have the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role in the storage account.\n",
    "- You must have network access to the storage account.\n",

    "**Important**: First, ensure that you've installed the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and then make sure to authenticate to Azure using `az login` in your terminal before running this notebook.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "From a terminal window, navigate to your working directory which contains this sample notebook, and execute the following.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, activate the virtual environment created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# %source .venv/bin/activate # If using Mac/Linux OS\n",
    ".venv/Scripts/activate # If using Windows OS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With your virtual environment activated, install the following packages required to execute this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install uv\n",
    "uv pip install azure-ai-evaluation[redteam] azure-identity python-dotenv azure-ai-projects\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open VSCode with the following command, and ensure your virtual environment is used as kernel to run the remainder of this notebook.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "code .\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated how to use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK's `RedTeam` functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems. We started with a basic fixed-response example and then moved to a more realistic model testing across multiple risk categories and attack strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated AI red teaming scans provides valuable insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overall Attack Success Rate (ASR)** - The percentage of attacks that successfully elicit harmful content\n",
    "2. **Vulnerability by Risk Category** - Which types of harmful content your model is most vulnerable to\n",
    "3. **Effectiveness of Attack Strategies** - Which attack techniques are most successful against your model\n",
    "4. **Impact of Complexity** - How more sophisticated attacks affect your model's safety guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "By regularly red-teaming your AI applications, you can identify and address potential vulnerabilities before deploying your models to production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigation**: Use these results to strengthen your model's guardrails against identified attack vectors\n",
    "2. **Continuous Testing**: Implement regular red team evaluations as part of your development lifecycle\n",
    "3. **Custom Strategies**: Develop custom attack strategies for your specific use cases and domain\n",
    "4. **Safety Layers**: Consider adding additional safety layers like Azure AI Content Safety to filter harmful requests and responses "
