      "Agent: Sure! The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The task involves creating two functions: one using recursion and another using iteration. We'll then compare their performance using a timing mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "- **Recursive Solution**: This function will call itself to compute Fibonacci numbers. The base cases are `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1`.\n",
      "- **Iterative Solution**: This function will use a `for` loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers, making it more efficient because recursion incurs a function-call overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will implement both solutions and compare their performance for a given Fibonacci number \\( n \\).For \\( n = 30 \\), here are the results of the Fibonacci calculations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recursive Implementation**:\n",
      "   - Result: \\( 832,040 \\)\n",
      "   - Time taken: \\( 0.1249 \\, \\text{seconds} \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Iterative Implementation**:\n",

      "   - Time taken: \\( 0.0000095 \\, \\text{seconds} \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Observations:\n",
      "- Both implementations give the correct result for \\( F(30) = 832,040 \\).\n",
      "- The **recursive** solution is significantly slower due to the function-call overhead and redundant calculations. It repeatedly computes the Fibonacci numbers for the same inputs (e.g., calculating \\( F(29) \\) multiple times for computing \\( F(30) \\)).\n",
      "- The **iterative** solution is far more efficient because it avoids redundant work and simply iterates over the required range while maintaining the prior two values in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "For large values of \\( n \\), the iterative method is much faster and should be preferred. If you still require recursion but with better performance, **memoization** (or dynamic programming techniques) can be used to cache intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Interpreter Tool**: The `HostedCodeInterpreterTool` allows agents to execute Python code in a secure environment\n",
    "2. **Mathematical Computation**: Perfect for complex calculations like factorials, statistics, and mathematical operations\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**: Can perform data analysis tasks including generating plots and statistics\n",
    "4. **Code Visibility**: You can access the actual code executed through `print_code_interpreter_inputs()`\n",
    "5. **Streaming Support**: Works with both streaming and non-streaming responses\n",
    "6. **Security**: Code execution happens in a secure, isolated environment\n",
    "7. **Versatility**: Can handle various programming tasks from simple calculations to complex algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions about what kind of code execution you need\n",
