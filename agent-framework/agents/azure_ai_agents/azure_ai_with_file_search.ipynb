    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Upload**: Documents must be uploaded to Azure AI before they can be searched\n",
    "2. **Vector Stores**: Files are organized in vector stores for efficient searching\n",
    "3. **File Search Tool**: The `HostedFileSearchTool` enables document-based question answering\n",
    "4. **Resource Management**: Always clean up uploaded files and vector stores to avoid costs\n",
    "5. **Multiple Files**: You can upload multiple documents to a single vector store\n",
    "6. **Document Types**: Supports PDF, TXT, DOCX, and other common document formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Management**: Keep track of uploaded files and their purposes\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Always handle upload and processing errors gracefully\n",
    "3. **Resource Cleanup**: Use try-finally blocks to ensure resource cleanup\n",
    "4. **Document Quality**: Ensure uploaded documents are well-formatted for better search results\n",
    "5. **Query Optimization**: Frame questions clearly to get better search results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Q&A**: Answer questions about uploaded documents\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base**: Create searchable knowledge bases from documents\n",
    "- **Research Assistant**: Help users find specific information in large document sets\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Search through policy documents and regulations\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Search through product manuals and documentation"
