    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Project**: Access to an Azure AI Foundry project with deployed models\n",
    "2. **Authentication**: Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login --use-device-code`)\n",
    "3. **Environment Variables**: Set up your `.env` file with connection details\n",
    "4. **Dependencies**: Required agent-framework packages installed\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use a different tenant, specify the tenant ID:\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Agents**: Agents can be created to persist beyond a single session, useful for production scenarios\n",
    "2. **Agent ID Management**: You can work with agents using their IDs, whether created programmatically or through the portal\n",
    "3. **Resource Management**: Always clean up agents when they're no longer needed to avoid unnecessary costs\n",
    "4. **Production Patterns**: This approach is suitable for production applications where agents need to be reused\n",
    "5. **Portal Integration**: Agents created in Azure AI Studio can be used directly in code\n",
    "6. **Client Flexibility**: You can create agents with or without providing a project client\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration to keep credentials secure\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Always use try-finally blocks to ensure agent cleanup\n",
    "3. **Agent Naming**: Use descriptive names for agents to make management easier\n",
    "4. **Documentation**: Keep track of agent IDs and their purposes\n",
    "5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor your Azure AI resource usage when working with persistent agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production Applications**: Where agents need to persist across multiple user sessions\n",
    "- **Team Collaboration**: Sharing agents across team members\n",
    "- **Multi-Session Conversations**: Maintaining agent state across sessions\n",
    "- **Agent Libraries**: Creating reusable agents for common tasks\n",
    "- **Integration with Azure AI Studio**: Using agents created through the web interface"
