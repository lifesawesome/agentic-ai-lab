    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bing Grounding Integration**: The `HostedWebSearchTool` provides seamless integration with Bing search capabilities\n",
    "2. **Environment Configuration**: The `BING_CONNECTION_ID` environment variable is crucial for connecting to your Azure AI project's Bing resource\n",
    "3. **Real-time Information**: Agents can now access current web information, making them more useful for time-sensitive queries\n",
    "4. **Source Citation**: The agent is instructed to cite sources, promoting transparency and reliability\n",
    "5. **Resource Management**: Using async context managers ensures proper cleanup of resources\n",
    "6. **Tool Integration**: The Bing search tool seamlessly integrates with the agent's existing capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues:\n",
    "1. **Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in with `az login`\n",
    "2. **Environment Variable**: Double-check that `BING_CONNECTION_ID` is correctly set\n",
    "3. **Azure AI Project**: Verify that Bing Grounding is properly configured in your Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "4. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the connected Bing search resource"
