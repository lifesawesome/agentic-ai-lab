    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bing Grounding Integration**: The `HostedWebSearchTool` provides seamless integration with Bing search capabilities\n",
    "2. **Connection Retrieval**: Use the Azure AI Project Client to retrieve the full connection ID from the connection name\n",
    "3. **Environment Configuration**: Set `BING_CONNECTION_NAME` in your `.env` file (just the name, not the full resource ID)\n",
    "4. **Real-time Information**: Agents can now access current web information, making them more useful for time-sensitive queries\n",
    "5. **Source Citation**: The agent is instructed to cite sources, promoting transparency and reliability\n",
    "6. **Resource Management**: Using async context managers ensures proper cleanup of resources\n",
    "7. **Tool Integration**: The Bing search tool seamlessly integrates with the agent's existing capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter issues:\n",
    "1. **Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in with `az login`\n",
    "2. **Connection Name**: Set `BING_CONNECTION_NAME` in your `.env` file with just the connection name (e.g., `foundrysearch`)\n",
    "3. **Azure AI Project**: Verify that Bing Grounding connection is properly configured in your Azure AI Foundry project\n",
    "4. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the connected Bing search resource\n",
    "5. **Connection Format**: The connection ID is automatically retrieved - you don't need to manually construct the full Azure Resource Manager path"
